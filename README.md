Marketing Matrix
\After I finish my first semester, I was so confused about deciding my first major. I remember reading the article about myopia marketing in BuzzFeed. And then the word myopia got stuck into my brain. Eventually, I got obsessed with researching the word. I found many fancy articles on marketing myopia along with some other topics related to marketing pitfalls.


Well, my intention was just to find the meaning of one word,
but lastly, it became one of my interests. That's how I decided to study my major in marketing.
















Marketing Matrix is a site where students can learn how to do projects and take ideas from my projects to make a better one.
I create projects for students worldwide. My projects cover the areas of marketing strategies, matrix, product development, market survival strategies, scenario analysis and branding.
